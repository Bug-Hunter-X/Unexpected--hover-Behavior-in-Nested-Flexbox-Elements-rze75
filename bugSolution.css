The solution involves making sure the inner element's hover style is more specific or the parent's hover is removed.  Here's corrected CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.container > div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/* Removed hover from parent*/

.inner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.inner:hover {
  background-color: darkgreen;
}
```

By removing the hover style from the parent element, the hover style on the child element will apply correctly.  Alternatively, adding more specific selectors could also work in more complex scenarios.
